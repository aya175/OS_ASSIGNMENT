EX1 – split()
fork() makes a copy of a running task.
If the result equals zero, that’s when it's running as the child.
If it’s above zero, then you're in the main process.
If it's –1, then the fork didn't work.
The program shows the PID for every process, also revealing how each runs separately.

Ex2 – Background Process
With &, the task runs behind the scenes.
snooze 300 but
jobs displays tasks running behind the scenes.

Ex3 – Stopping a Process
Find the PID using:
ps aux | grep sleep
Kill  instead
Look once more using ps aux | grep sleep.

Ex4 – Pause and Resume
Pause a process:
kill -STOP
Resume it:
kill -CONT

Ex5 – Linker
We created a pair of C files.
A single file holds the action, while another triggers it.
The linker ties them together - forming a single runnable file.
If you tweak a file then recompile, the linker adjusts the end program.

EX6 – Loader
The loader puts the program into memory while pulling in needed shared libraries.
Running ldd on simple_program reveals which libs it relies on.
